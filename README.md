# php-texttoimage
A PHP class that takes text and turns it into a PNG file.  This will ultimately be appropriate for generating memes (just to offer one example).

This is very much a work in progress.  Right now, it will produce images that have black text on a white background.  Still to implement are:
* text colors
* background color
* header and footer background images
* image height limiter
